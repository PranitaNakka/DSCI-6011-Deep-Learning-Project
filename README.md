# PROJECT - FOOD RECOGNITION SYSTEM

This repository contains a description, dataset - images , and code for our project.

## Statement of project objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust food recognition system that can accurately identify and classify images of food into one of 101 categories based on the Food-101 dataset. This system aims to facilitate nutritional tracking, aid culinary education, enhance dietary management apps, and support the food service industry by automating food identification processes.

## Statement of value - why is this project worth doing?:
This project is worth doing because:
Health and Nutrition: It can significantly improve the ease and accuracy of tracking food intake, which is crucial for individuals monitoring their diet for health reasons.
Educational Value: It can serve as an educational tool in culinary schools and for home cooks to learn about various dishes.
Industry Applications: Restaurants and food services can use this technology for inventory management, menu planning, and enhancing customer experience through interactive apps.

## Approach (i.e., what algorithms, datasets, models, tools, and techniques we intend to use to achieve the project objectives):
### Algorithm:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): The core of your model will be CNNs due to their excellence in handling image data. Specific architectures to consider include:
ResNet-50 or ResNet-101: These models are deep enough to capture complex patterns in food images, yet efficient in terms of computational resources.
Transfer Learning: Start with pre-trained models on ImageNet to leverage learned features which are common across general image recognition tasks, and fine-tune them on the Food-101 dataset.
Data Augmentation: To improve model robustness and reduce overfitting, employ data augmentation techniques such as rotations, scaling, cropping, and color adjustments.

### Tecniques:
Model Optimization and Tuning: Use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
Regularization Techniques: Implement dropout, L2 regularization (weight decay), and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
Early Stopping: Monitor validation loss during training and stop training when performance stops improving significantly.
Model Evaluation: Periodic evaluation during training using validation data to monitor performance metrics like loss and accuracy, adjusting strategies as needed

### Tools and technologies:
Python: As the primary programming language due to its wide support and libraries for machine learning.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: These are the two leading libraries for developing machine learning models. Choose based on your familiarity and the specific features you need (e.g., TensorFlow's TPU support or PyTorch's dynamic computation graph).
OpenCV: Useful for handling image processing tasks outside of the deep learning model.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions and model performance metrics.
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab: For interactive development and experimentation, particularly useful in the early stages of model design and testing.

### Dataset:
Food-101 Dataset: This dataset consists of 101,000 food images grouped into 101 categories. Each class contains 1000 images which provide a balanced dataset for training and testing.

## Evaluation Methodology:
### Accuracy:
Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of cases examined. For a food recognition system, it quantifies how often the model correctly identifies the category of food in an image. The formula for accuracy is:
Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions
On the Test Set: After training and validation, evaluate the model’s accuracy on the unseen test set. This provides an unbiased evaluation of the model’s performance in the real world.

### Precision: 
Precision, also known as positive predictive value, measures the accuracy of the detected objects. It is the ratio of correctly identified objects (true positives) to the total number of objects identified by the model (the sum of true positives and false positives). In simpler terms, it answers the question: "Of all the objects the model identified, how many were identified correctly?
" The formula for precision is: Precision=True Positives (TP)True Positives (TP)+False Positives (FP)Precision=True Positives (TP)+False Positives (FP)True Positives (TP)​

### Recall:
Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the model's ability to correctly identify all relevant objects in the image. It is the ratio of correctly identified objects (true positives) to the total number of actual objects in the image (the sum of true positives and false negatives). Recall answers the question: "Of all the actual objects present, how many did the model correctly identify?"
The formula for recall is: Recall=True Positives (TP)True Positives (TP)+False Negatives (FN)Recall=True Positives (TP)+False Negatives (FN)True Positives (TP)​

### F-1 Score:
The F-1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a single metric that balances both. It is particularly useful when you need to compare two or more models that might have different precision and recall values. 
The F-1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0. It is calculated as: 
F-1 Score=2×Precision×Recall/Precision+Recall
